The pH of the culture was set at 7.2±0.05 with the addition of 15% ammonium hydroxide and Dow Chemical P2000 antifoam was added as needed for foam control. When the culture reached an OD600 of between 35±5 (when the initial glycerol in the batch medium was nearly depleted), a bolus feed of 200 mL was given initiated and at the same time the pH set point was adjusted from 7.2 to 6.6.

       "   'Study Design: This will be a Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study in healthy male volunteers. Eighteen subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequence groups (nine subjects/group). Relaxin is administered over two separate dosing periods as a bolus s.c. injection in the upper thigh using equivalent doses of the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and the commercially available product chosen. The dose and frequency of administration of the commercially available product is as instructed in the package label. Additional dosing, dosing frequency, or other parameter as desired, using the commercially available products may be added to the study by including additional groups of subjects. Each dosing period is separated by a 14-day washout period. Subjects are confined to the study center at least 12 hours prior to and 72 hours following dosing for each of the two dosing periods, but not between dosing periods. Additional groups of subjects may be added if there are to be additional dosing, frequency, or other parameter, to be tested for the PEGylated relaxin as well. The experimental formulation of relaxin is the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.',\n",
       "   'Blood Sampling: Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration of relaxin. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum relaxin concentrations are obtained at about 30, 20, and 10 minutes prior to dosing (3 baseline samples) and at approximately the following times after dosing: 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at −20° C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. Fasting clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) are performed immediately prior to the initial dose on day 1, the morning of day 4, immediately prior to dosing on day 16, and the morning of day 19.',\n",
       "   'Bioanalytical Methods: An ELISA kit is used for the determination of serum relaxin concentrations.',\n",
       "   'Safety Determinations: Vital signs are recorded immediately prior to each dosing (Days 1 and 16), and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after each dosing. Safety determinations are based on the incidence and type of adverse events and the changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline. In addition, changes from pre-study in vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, and physical examination results are evaluated.',\n",
       "   'Data Analysis Post-dose serum concentration values are corrected for pre-dose baseline relaxin concentrations by subtracting from each of the post-dose values the mean baseline relaxin concentration determined from averaging the relaxin levels from the three samples collected at 30, 20, and 10 minutes before dosing. Pre-dose serum relaxin concentrations are not included in the calculation of the mean value if they are below the quantification level of the assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum concentration data corrected for baseline relaxin concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (Cmax); time to peak serum concentration (tmax); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUC0-72) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), computed from the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation/non-preserved formulation) is calculated.',\n",
       "   'Safety Results: The incidence of adverse events is equally distributed across the treatment groups. There are no clinically significant changes from baseline or pre-study clinical laboratory tests or blood pressures, and no notable changes from pre-study in physical examination results and vital sign measurements. The safety profiles for the two treatment groups should appear similar.',\n",
       "   'Pharmacokinetic Results: Mean serum relaxin concentration-time profiles (uncorrected for baseline relaxin levels) in all 18 subjects after receiving PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid at each time point measured. All subjects should have pre-dose baseline relaxin concentrations within the normal physiologic range. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum data corrected for pre-dose mean baseline relaxin concentrations and the Cmax and tmax are determined. The mean tmax for the any clinical comparator(s) chosen is significantly shorter than the tmax for the PEGylated relaxin comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Terminal half-life values are significantly shorter for the preclinical comparator(s) tested compared with the terminal half-life for the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.',\n",
       "   'Although the present study is conducted in healthy male subjects, similar absorption characteristics and safety profiles would be anticipated in other patient populations; such as male or female patients with diabetes, male or female patients with cancer or chronic renal failure, pediatric renal failure patients, patients in autologous predeposit programs, or patients scheduled for elective surgery.',\n",
       "   'In conclusion, subcutaneously administered single doses of PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be safe and well tolerated by healthy male subjects. Based on a comparative incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination results, the safety profiles of the commercially available forms of relaxin and PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be equivalent. The PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid potentially provides large clinical utility to patients and health care providers.']},\n",

All animals in Groups 1 through 8 were bled at three time points: baseline (pre-dose t=0) and 2 and 6 hours post-initiation of infusion for wild-type relaxin IV dosing and post IV dosing for PEG-Relaxin dosing groups, respectively. The time of initiation of IV infusion dosing and the actual time of each bleed were recorded in the raw data for each animal.
