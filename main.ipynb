Relaxin is administered over two separate dosing periods as a bolus s.c. injection in the upper thigh using equivalent doses of the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and the commercially available product chosen. The dose and frequency of administration of the commercially available product is as instructed in the package label. Additional dosing, dosing frequency, or other parameter as desired, using the commercially available products may be added to the study by including additional groups of subjects. Each dosing period is separated by a 14-day washout period. Subjects are confined to the study center at least 12 hours prior to and 72 hours following dosing for each of the two dosing periods, but not between dosing periods. Additional groups of subjects may be added if there are to be additional dosing, frequency, or other parameter, to be tested for the PEGylated relaxin as well. The experimental formulation of relaxin is the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.',\n",
       "   'Blood Sampling: Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration of relaxin. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum relaxin concentrations are obtained at about 30, 20, and 10 minutes prior to dosing (3 baseline samples) and at approximately the following times after dosing: 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at −20° C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. Fasting clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) are performed immediately prior to the initial dose on day 1, the morning of day 4, immediately prior to dosing on day 16, and the morning of day 19.',\n",
       "   'Bioanalytical Methods: An ELISA kit is used for the determination of serum relaxin concentrations.',\n",
       "   'Safety Determinations: Vital signs are recorded immediately prior to each dosing (Days 1 and 16), and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after each dosing. Safety determinations are based on the incidence and type of adverse events and the changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline. In addition, changes from pre-study in vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, and physical examination results are evaluated.',\n",
       "   'Data Analysis Post-dose serum concentration values are corrected for pre-dose baseline relaxin concentrations by subtracting from each of the post-dose values the mean baseline relaxin concentration determined from averaging the relaxin levels from the three samples collected at 30, 20, and 10 minutes before dosing. Pre-dose serum relaxin concentrations are not included in the calculation of the mean value if they are below the quantification level of the assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum concentration data corrected for baseline relaxin concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (Cmax); time to peak serum concentration (tmax); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUC0-72) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), computed from the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation/non-preserved formulation) is calculated.',\n",
       "   'Safety Results: The incidence of adverse events is equally distributed across the treatment groups. There are no clinically significant changes from baseline or pre-study clinical laboratory tests or blood pressures, and no notable changes from pre-study in physical examination results and vital sign measurements. The safety profiles for the two treatment groups should appear similar.',\n",
       "   'Pharmacokinetic Results: Mean serum relaxin concentration-time profiles (uncorrected for baseline relaxin levels) in all 18 subjects after receiving PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid at each time point measured. All subjects should have pre-dose baseline relaxin concentrations within the normal physiologic range. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum data corrected for pre-dose mean baseline relaxin concentrations and the Cmax and tmax are determined. The mean tmax for the any clinical comparator(s) chosen is significantly shorter than the tmax for the PEGylated relaxin comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Terminal half-life values are significantly shorter for the preclinical comparator(s) tested compared with the terminal half-life for the PEGylated relaxin comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.',\n",
       "   'Although the present study is conducted in healthy male subjects, similar absorption characteristics and safety profiles would be anticipated in other patient populations; such as male or female patients with diabetes, male or female patients with cancer or chronic renal failure, pediatric renal failure patients, patients in autologous predeposit programs, or patients scheduled for elective surgery.',\n",
       "   'In conclusion, subcutaneously administered single doses of PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be safe and well tolerated by healthy male subjects. Based on a comparative incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination results, the safety profiles of the commercially available forms of relaxin and PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be equivalent. The PEGylated relaxin comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid potentially provides large clinical utility to patients and health care providers.']},\n",

       "[{'Example 1: 1. Growth Conditions and Light Treatment Conditions for Plants': 'In the following examples, experiments were carried out on kale, which belongs to the Brassicaceae family, among plants as a representative example. The kale was grown for a total of 31 days and harvested on the 32nd day. The growth conditions of the kale according to an experimental example are shown in FIG. 4. Hereinafter, in drawings, for the convenience of explanation, a period during which the light corresponding to FIG. 3B is irradiated is shown as the first period, a period during which the light corresponding to FIG. 3C is irradiated is shown as the second period, and other features are described separately. With reference to FIG. 4, a control group will be described first. The kale was germinated in the dark period for about 2 days after being sowed. In other words, kale seeds were first sowed into a cultivation sponge and germinated in the dark period for about 2 days to grow the kale. The kale was grown in the light period and the dark period from day 3 to day 9 after sowing, and this corresponds to an irradiation period before transplanting. The light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3A was irradiated to the kale in the light period at a light intensity of about 69.8 umol/m2/s PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density). Only the purified water was provided to the plants after sowing and before transplanting. The grown sprouts were transplanted in a deep-flow technique (DFT) hydroponic culture system on the 10th day. The transplanted kale was grown in nutrient solution under the light and dark periods. As the nutrient solution, Hoagland stock solution was used, and the pH of the nutrient solution was maintained at about 5.5 to about 6.5. After the transplanting, the light period and the dark period were provided on the 24-hour basis for about 21 days. On the 24-hour basis, the light period was maintained for about 16 hours, and the dark period was maintained for about 8 hours. The light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3B was irradiated to the kale in the light period at a light intensity of about 152.8 umol/m2/s PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density). Control group 1 was irradiated with the light corresponding to FIG. 3B in the light period till the 30th day from the date of transplanting. Treatment group 1 was irradiated with the light under the same condition as the control group till the 29th day from the date of transplanting. However, treatment group 1 was irradiated with the light having the spectra shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C in the light period under a certain condition on the 30th day from the date of transplanting. Treatment group 2 was irradiated with the light under the same condition as the control group till the 28th day from the date of transplanting. However, treatment group 2 was irradiated with the light having the spectra shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C in the light period under a certain condition on the 29th and 30th days from the date of transplanting. In this case, the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C was continuously irradiated during the light period of about 16 hours each for two days. Treatment group 3 was irradiated with the light under the same condition as the control group till the 27th day from the date of transplanting. However, treatment group 3 was irradiated with the light having the spectra shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C in the light period under a certain condition on the 28th to 30th days from the date of transplanting. In this case, the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C was irradiated in an on and off manner for a predetermined period. As an example, the irradiation of the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C was repeated over a period of about 3 days in a 16-hour light period in a manner in which a 5-minute irradiation is followed by a 75-minute non-irradiation until the end of the light period.',\n",
       "  'Example 2: 2. Comparison of Active Ingredient Content by Irradiation with UVA and UVB': 'In the present experiment, effects on the plants, which are caused by the light irradiation of the light source in the second period, were observed. The light irradiated in the second period in the present experiment has substantially the same spectrum as that of FIG. 3B in the visible light wavelength band; however, the light irradiated in the second period in the present experiment has the spectra respectively corresponding to the ultraviolet ray A (UVA) and the ultraviolet ray B (UVB) in the ultraviolet wavelength band. FIG. 5 shows experimental conditions in the present exemplary embodiment, and the experimental conditions correspond to the control group and treatment group 2 of FIG. 4. In detail, in FIG. 5, comparative example 1 corresponds to the control group of FIG. 4, and the dark period and the light period were respectively maintained during about 8 hours and about 16 hours for last two days before harvesting. Each of experimental example 1 and experimental example 2 corresponds to treatment group 2 of FIG. 4. However, a light irradiated in experimental example 1 corresponds to the light having the peak corresponding to the UVB in the ultraviolet wavelength band of the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C, and a light irradiated in experimental example 2 corresponds to the light having the peak corresponding to the UVA in the ultraviolet wavelength band of the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C. The UVA and the UVB were set to have different light intensities such that total energy amounts were equal to each other. In the present exemplary embodiment, the total energy amount and the light intensity of the UVA and the UVB were values corresponding to the ultraviolet wavelength band except the visible light, the UVB was supplied at a total energy amount of about 11.52 kJ/m2 and a light intensity of about 10 uW/cm2, and the UVA was supplied at a total energy amount of about 1,152 kJ/m2 and a light intensity of about 1000 uW/cm2. FIGS. 6A to 6C are graphs sequentially showing contents of chlorophylls, flavonols, and anthocyanins contained in the kale harvested on the 31st day after the date of sowing, after the light treatment was performed under the above conditions. Referring to FIGS. 6A to 6C, when the UVA and the UVB were applied to the plants, both the UVA and UVB irradiation increased the content of active ingredients in the plants. However, even though the UVA and the UVB were provided to the plants at the same energy, the content of the active ingredients was significantly higher when the UVB was provided to the plants than when the UVA was provided to the plants. Accordingly, it was found that the use of UVB as the light was more advantageous to increase the content of the active ingredients among the UVA and the UVB, and hereinafter, the content of the active ingredients and the damage of the plants were examined based on the UVB.',\n",
       "  'Example 3: 3. Comparison of Damage to Plants and Active Ingredient Content of Plants Due to Irradiation Dose of UVB': 'In the present experiment, the damage on the plants depending on an irradiation time was observed. A light used in the second period of the present experiment has a peak corresponding to the UVB and the visible light wavelength band and has substantially the same spectrum of FIG. 3C. FIG. 7 shows experimental conditions in the present exemplary embodiment, and the experimental conditions correspond to the control group and treatment group 1 of FIG. 4. In detail, in FIG. 7, comparative example 2 corresponds to the control group of FIG. 4, and the dark period and the light period were respectively maintained during about 8 hours and about 16 hours for last two days before harvesting. Each of experimental example 3 and experimental example 4 corresponds to treatment group 1 of FIG. 4. However, in experimental example 3, the light shown in FIG. 3C was irradiated in the light period for about 3 hours, and in experimental example 4, the light shown in FIG. 3C was irradiated in the light period for about 6 hours. The total energy amount is a value corresponding to the ultraviolet wavelength band except the visible light. In the present exemplary embodiment, the total energy amount of the UVB in experimental example 3 was about 1.08 kJ/m2, and the total energy amount of the UVB in experimental example 4 was about 2.16 kJ/m2. FIGS. 8A to 8D are photographs showing experimental results of comparative example 2, experimental example 3, and experimental example 4. In FIGS. 8A to 8D, the kale on the left side in each photograph corresponds to the control group. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 8A is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where one day has elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 3, and the photograph on the right side of FIG. 8B is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where one day has elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 4. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 8C is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where 4 days have elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 3, and the photograph on the right side of FIG. 8D is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where 4 days have elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 4. Referring to FIGS. 8A to 8D, when the light corresponding to the UVB was applied for about 3 hours, the damage of the plants was not observed at a time point where one day has elapsed; however, leaf curling and browning phenomena were observed in the kale applied with the light for about 6 hours at a time point where 4 days have elapsed. As a result, it was found that the UVB causes the damage to the plants when being applied for a predetermined time or more, for example, for about 6 hours or more. FIGS. 9A to 9C are graphs sequentially showing contents of chlorophylls, flavonols, and anthocyanins contained in the kale harvested on the 31st day after the date of sowing in comparative example 2, experimental example 3, and experimental example 4. Referring to FIGS. 9A to 9C, when the UVB is applied to the plants, the active ingredients were at least maintained or the content of the active ingredients was increased. However, the tendency for the increase and the maintenance of the active ingredients depending on time of UVB irradiation was not directly observed to a meaningful extent. For example, in the case of chlorophylls, the content of chlorophylls of experimental example 3 was significantly increased as compared with that of the control group, but, different from experimental example 3, in the case of experimental example 4, it is difficult to determine that the content of chlorophylls was significantly increased as compared with that of the control group. In the case of flavonols, the content of flavonols in experimental examples 3 and 4 was significantly increased as compared with the control group. However, in the case of anthocyanins, there was no significant change in experimental example 3 as compared with the control group, and the content of anthocyanins was significantly increased in experimental example 4. Through this experiment, when the plants are exposed to the UVB for about 6 hours or more to receive the energy of about 2.16 kJ/m2, it was observed that the plants may be damaged from irradiation of light.',\n",
       "  'Example 4: 4. Comparison of Damage to Plants and Active Ingredient Content of Plants Depending on Continuous Irradiation or On and Off Irradiation of UVB': 'In the present experiment, influences on the plants depending on a continuous irradiation method or an on and off irradiation method of the light source were observed. FIG. 10 shows experimental conditions in the present exemplary embodiment and corresponds to the control group and treatment group 3 of FIG. 4. In detail, in FIG. 10, comparative example 3 corresponds to the control group of FIG. 4, and the dark period and the light period were respectively maintained during about 8 hours and about 16 hours for last two days before harvesting. Each of experimental example 5 and experimental example 6 corresponds to treatment group 3 of FIG. 4. However, in experimental example 5, the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C was irradiated in the light period for about 3 hours, and the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3B was irradiated in the light period for about 13 hours. The light irradiation in the above-described method was repeated for about 3 days. In experimental example 6, the light having the spectrum shown in FIG. 3C was provided for about 3 hours in the light period, and the irradiation method in which the 5-minute irradiation is followed by the 75-minute non-irradiation was repeated until the end of the light period in the light period of about 16 hours. The light irradiation method described above was repeated for about 3 days. Therefore, a total time during which the light is applied in experimental example 5 is substantially the same as that in experimental example 6, and a total energy applied in experimental example 5 is substantially the same as that in experimental example 6. The total energy amount was a value corresponding to the ultraviolet wavelength band except the visible light. In the present exemplary embodiment, the total energy amount of the UVB in experimental examples 5 and 6 was about 1.08 kJ/m2. FIGS. 11A and 11B are photographs showing experimental results of comparative example 3, experimental example 5, and experimental example 6. In FIGS. 11A and 11B, the kale on the left side in each photograph corresponds to the control group. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 11A is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where the kale was harvested when the light has been applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 5. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 11B is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where the kale was harvested when the light has been applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 6. Referring to FIGS. 11A and 11B, there was almost no damage on the kale in experimental example 5 in which the light was continuously irradiated for about 3 hours. However, in the case of experimental example 6 in which the light was irradiated for about 3 hours in a flickering manner, leaf curling phenomenon in the kale was observed, and a few color changes were also observed. Through this, it was found that the continuous irradiation of the UVB was safer to the plants than the irradiation of the UVB in the on and off manner. FIGS. 12A to 12C are graphs sequentially showing contents of chlorophylls, flavonols, and anthocyanins contained in the kale harvested on the 31st day after the date of sowing in comparative example 3, experimental example 5, and experimental example 6. Referring to FIGS. 12A to 12C, the content of the active ingredient varied from one active ingredient to another depending on whether the light is irradiated in the continuous method or in the on and off method. In the case of chlorophylls, there was no meaningful difference in the content of chlorophylls between the control group and experimental example 5, but in experimental example 6, the content of chlorophylls was significantly increased as compared with the control group. In the case of flavonols, the content of flavonols in experimental examples 5 and 6 was significantly increased as compared with the control group. In the case of anthocyanins, the content of anthocyanins in experimental example 5 was significantly increased as compared with the control group. However, in experimental example 6, the content of anthocyanins was increased as compared with the control group, but the difference was not meaningful. However, a tendency of the active ingredient content to increase by the light irradiation was evident, and it was found that the increase of the content of the active ingredients was greater in the case of continuous light irradiation than in the case of on and off light irradiation.',\n",
       "  'Example 5: 5. Whether the Active Ingredient Content is Increased when the UVB is Irradiated Under the Dark Period': 'In the present experiment, influences on the plants depending on whether the light corresponding to the UVB is irradiated in the dark period or is irradiated in the light period were observed. FIG. 13 shows experimental conditions in the present exemplary embodiment and corresponds to the control group and treatment group 1 of FIG. 4. In detail, in FIG. 13, comparative example 4 corresponds to the control group of FIG. 4, and the dark period and the light period were respectively maintained during about 8 hours and about 16 hours during the last day (for 1 day) before harvesting. Each of experimental example 7 and experimental example 8 corresponds to treatment group 1 of FIG. 4. However, in experimental example 8, the light having the spectrum corresponding to the UVB was irradiated in the dark period for about 3 hours, and the light having the spectrum corresponding to FIG. 3B was irradiated in the light period for about 16 hours. In this case, the light provided in the dark period was only the UVB, and the light in the visible light wavelength band was not provided. (The second period in which the UVB is provided is marked by “*”.) In experimental example 7, the light having the spectrum corresponding to FIG. 3C was provided for about 3 hours in the light period, and the light having the spectrum corresponding to FIG. 3B was provided for about 13 hours corresponding to a remaining light period. The total energy amount shown in FIG. 13 was a value corresponding to the ultraviolet wavelength band except the visible light. In the present exemplary embodiment, the total energy amount of the UVB in experimental examples 7 and 8 was about 1.08 kJ/m2. FIGS. 14A to 14D are photographs showing experimental results of comparative example 4, experimental example 7, and experimental example 8. In FIGS. 14A to 14D, the kale on the left side in each photograph corresponds to the control group. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 14A is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where one day has elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 7, and the photograph on the right side of FIG. 14B is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where one day has elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 8. The photograph on the right side of FIG. 14C is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where 4 days have elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 7, and the photograph on the right side of FIG. 14D is a photograph of the kale at a point in time where 4 day have elapsed after the light was applied according to the light condition described in experimental example 8. Referring to FIGS. 14A to 14D, in the case where the light corresponding to the UVB was applied to the plants in the dark period, the damage on the plants was not observed at the time point where one day has elapsed, however, leaf curling and browning phenomena were observed in the kale at the time point where 4 days have elapsed. In the case where the light corresponding to the UVB was applied to the plants in the light period, the damage of the plants was not observed at both time points where one day has elapsed and where 4 days have elapsed. Through this, it was found that the UVB easily damages the plants in the dark period rather than in the light period. FIGS. 15A to 15C are graphs sequentially showing contents of chlorophylls, flavonols, and anthocyanins contained in the kale harvested on the 31st day after the date of sowing in comparative example 4, experimental example 7, and experimental example 8. Referring to FIGS. 15A to 15C, in the case where the light corresponding to the UVB was applied to the plants in the light period or the dark period, the content of chlorophylls and the content of flavonols among the active ingredients were significantly increased. However, in the case of anthocyanins, no meaningful increase in the active ingredient content was found.',\n",
       "  'Example 6: 6. Whether UVB Irradiation Under the Light Cycle Increases the Predetermined Substance Content of Various Cruciferous Plants': \"In this experiment, the effects of cruciferous plants were observed when no UVB light was irradiated and when irradiated in the light period. To this end, in the following examples, additional experiments were conducted on a tatsoi (Asia vitamin), mustard, and broccoli among cruciferous plants. FIG. 16 shows experimental conditions in an embodiment, in which comparative examples and experimental examples correspond to comparative example 4 and experimental example 7 of FIG. 13, respectively, and the experimental conditions are the same between each other. FIGS. 17A to 17C are graphs sequentially showing contents of chlorophylls, flavonols, and anthocyanins contained in tatsoi, mustard, and broccoli harvested on the 31st day after the date of sowing, after the light treatment was performed in comparative examples and experimental examples according to the experimental conditions of FIG. 16. Referring to FIGS. 17A to 17C, in the case of the experimental example irradiated with UVB in the light period, the content of the chlorophylls, flavonols, anthocyanins are all increased compared to the comparative example not irradiated. In particular, in the case of chlorophylls, a significant increase of the contents for tatsoi (Asia vitamin) and mustard was observed in the experimental example with UVB irradiation in the light period. In the case of flavonols, a significant increase of the contents for all of tatsoi, mustard, and broccoli was observed in the experimental example with UVB irradiation in the light period. In the case of anthocyanins, the contents for tatsoi, mustard and broccoli were not so remarkably increased, but still considerably increased. FIGS. 18A to 18C are photographs showing the experimental results of the comparative example and the experimental example according to the experimental conditions of FIG. 16. Referring to FIGS. 18A to 18C, in the case of the experimental example irradiated with UVB in the light period, no special change in appearance, for example, leaf-curling, browning, and death was not found compared to the comparative example which is not irradiated. As could be seen from the above-described embodiments, the light source according to the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides the light having the specific wavelength to the adult plants in a specified method during the predetermined period, and thus the plants with the high active ingredient content may be obtained. The light source according to the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may be used for plant cultivation, and in detail, the light source may be applied to a plant cultivation device and a greenhouse each in which a light source is installed. FIG. 19 is a perspective view showing a cultivation device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The cultivation device shown in FIG. 19 corresponds to a small-sized cultivation device; however, it should not be limited thereto or thereby. Referring to FIG. 19, the cultivation device 100 according to the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure includes a housing 60 having an inner space capable of growing the plants and a light source 30 provided in the housing 60 to emit a light. The housing 60 provides an empty space therein within which the plants may be provided and may be grown. The housing 60 may be provided in a box shape that is capable of blocking an external light. In some embodiments, the housing 60 may include a lower case 61 opened upward and an upper case 63 opened downward. The lower case 61 and the upper case 63 may be coupled to each other to form the box shape that blocks the external light. The lower case 61 includes a bottom portion and a sidewall portion extending upward from the bottom portion. The upper case 63 includes a cover portion and a sidewall portion extending downward from the cover portion. The sidewall portions of the lower case 61 and the upper case 63 may have structures engaged with each other. The lower case 61 and the upper case 63 may be coupled to each other or separated from each other depending on a user's intention, and thus a user may open or close the housing 60. The housing 60 may be provided in various shapes. For example, the housing 60 may have a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape or may have a cylindrical shape. However, the shape of the housing 60 should not be limited thereto or thereby, and the housing 60 may be provided in other shapes. The housing 60 provides an environment in which the plants provided therein may be grown. The housing 60 may have a size that is capable of accommodating a plurality of plants provided and grown therein. In addition, the size of the housing 60 may be changed depending on a use of the plant cultivation device 100. For example, in a case where the plant cultivation device 100 is used for a small-scale plant cultivation at home, the size of the housing 60 may be relatively small. In a case where the plant cultivation device 100 is used for commercial plant cultivation, the size of the housing 60 may be relatively large. In some embodiments, the housing 60 may block the light such that the external light is not incident into the housing 60. Accordingly, a dark room environment, which is isolated from the outside, may be provided inside the housing 60. Therefore, the external light may be prevented from being unnecessarily irradiated to the plants provided inside the housing 60. In particular, the housing 60 may prevent an external visible light from being irradiated to the plants. However, in some cases, the housing 60 may be designed to be partially opened, and thus the housing 60 may receive the external light as it is. The space inside the housing 60 may be provided as one space. However, this is for the convenience of explanation, and the space inside the housing 60 may be divided into a plurality of compartments. That is, partition walls may be provided in the housing 60 to divide the space inside the housing 60 into the compartments. The light source provides the light to the plants in the space of the housing 60. The light source is disposed on an inner surface of the upper case 63 or the lower case 61. The light source may be disposed on the cover portion of the upper case 63. The light source disposed on an inner surface of the cover portion of the upper case 63 is shown, however, it should not be limited thereto or thereby. For example, the light source may be disposed on the sidewall portion of the upper case 63. As another example, the light source may be disposed on the sidewall portion of the lower case 61, e.g., on an upper end of the sidewall portion. As further another example, the light source may be disposed on at least one of the cover portion of the upper case 63, the sidewall portion of the upper case 63, and the sidewall portion of the lower case 61. A culture platform 70 may be provided in the space of the housing 60 to cultivate the plant easily, for example, for facilitating a hydroponic culture. The culture platform 70 may include a plate-shaped plate 71 disposed at a position spaced apart upward from the bottom portion of the housing 60. Through-holes 73 with a uniform size may be provided through the plate 71. The culture platform 70 may be provided to allow the plants to be grown on an upper surface of the plate 71 and may include a plurality of through-holes 73 to allow water supplied thereto to be drained when the water is supplied. The through-hole 73 may be provided in a size such that the plants do not slip through. For example, the through-hole 73 may have a diameter smaller than the plants. A space between the culture platform 70 and the bottom portion of the lower case 61 may serve as a water tank in which the drained water is stored. Accordingly, the water drained downward through the through-hole 73 of the culture platform 70 may be stored in the space between the bottom portion of the lower case 61 and the culture platform 70. However, in some embodiments, plants in the family Poaceae may also be cultivated by methods other than the hydroponic culture method. In this case, water, a culture medium, and soil may be provided in the space of the housing 60 to supply the water and/or nutrients necessary for the plants in the family Poaceae, and the housing 60 may serve as a container. The culture medium or the soil may contain the nutrients for the plants to grow, such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and iron (Fe). The seeds may be provided while being imbedded in the culture medium or may be placed on a surface of the culture medium depending on its type. The culture platform 70 may have a size and a shape, which vary depending on the shape of the housing 60 and the providing manner of a first light source and a second light source. The size and the shape of the culture platform 70 may be configured to allow the plants provided on the culture platform 70 to be placed within an irradiation range of the light irradiated from the first light source and the second light source. The housing 60 may include a water supply unit disposed therein to supply water to the plants. The water supply unit may be configured to be disposed at an upper end of the housing 60, e.g., on the inner surface of the cover portion of the upper case 63, and to spray water onto the culture platform 70. However, the configuration of the water supply unit should not be limited thereto or thereby, and the configuration of the water supply unit may vary depending on the shape of the housing 60 and the arrangement of the culture platform 70. In addition, the user may directly supply the water into the housing 60 without a separate water supply unit. The water supply unit may be provided in a singular or plural number. The number of the water supply units may be changed depending on the size of the housing 60. For instance, in the case of the relatively small-sized plant cultivation device for the home usage, one water supply unit may be used since the size of the housing is small. In the case of the relatively large-sized commercial plant cultivation device, the plural water supply units may be used since the size of the housing 60 is large. However, the number of the water supply units should not be limited thereto or thereby and may be provided in a variety of positions in various numbers. The water supply unit may be connected to a water tank provided in the housing 60 or a faucet outside the housing 60. In addition, the water supply unit may further include a filtration unit such that contaminants floating in the water are not provided to the plants. The filtration unit may include a filter, such as an activated carbon filter or a non-woven fabric filter, and thus the water passing through the filtration unit may be purified. The filtration unit may further include a light irradiation filter. The light irradiation filter may remove germs, bacteria, fungal spores, and the like, which are present in the water, by irradiating an ultraviolet light or the like to the water. As the water supply unit includes the above-mentioned filtration unit, there is no possibility that the inside of the house 60 and the plants are contaminated even when water is recycled or rainwater or the like is directly used for the cultivation. The water provided from the water supply unit may be provided as plain water itself (for example, purified water) without additional nutrients, however, it should not be limited thereto or thereby, and the water provided from the water supply unit may contain nutrients necessary for the growth of the plant. For example, the water may contain a material, such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and iron (Fe), and a material, such as nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, and chloride (Cl). For instance, Sachs's solution, Knop's solution, Hoagland's solution, or Hewitt's solution may be supplied from the water supply unit. According to the exemplary embodiment, the plants may be cultivated using the light source. A plant cultivation method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may include germinating a seed of the plants and providing the light in the visible light wavelength band to the germinated plant. The light provided to the plants is emitted from the light sources according to the above-described embodiments, and the light in the visible light wavelength band may include at least two or three lights among first, second, third, and fourth lights having different light spectra from each other. Although the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have been described, it is understood that the present disclosure should not be limited to these exemplary embodiments but various changes and modifications can be made by one ordinary skilled in the art within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as hereinafter claimed. Therefore, the disclosed subject matter should not be limited to any single embodiment described herein, and the scope of the present disclosure shall be determined according to the attached claims.\"}]"
