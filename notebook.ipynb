       "'FIG. 2 shows a system 200 consisting of a series of four vertically arranged grow trays 201, 202, 203, 204. It will be understood that the number of trays is more or less arbitrary, and other embodiments may include more or fewer trays. The system also includes a reservoir, pump and conduit (not shown in this figure), and it will be understood that any known reservoir, pump and conduit combination may be used provided that the combination can convey liquid stored in the reservoir to a nozzle 205 or other suitable outlet located above the uppermost grow tray 201. In some embodiments, the reservoir, pump and conduit may be substantially similar to those in existing systems (with any direct connections between the conduit and the trays removed), reducing the cost of converting an existing growing system.\\nEach grow tray is provided with a valve assembly 206, comprising a filling catchment 207 and a drainage outlet 208. The drainage outlet is sized to fit into an opening in the grow tray so that liquid can pass out of the grow tray through the drainage outlet. The filling catchment in this embodiment has a plurality of drainage orifices or openings 210 which allow liquid to leave the filling catchment and enter the interior of the tray. Each grow tray also includes an overflow outlet 209 which sets a maximum height to which the grow tray may be filled.\\nIn FIG. 2, the system is in a state where the pump has been turned off and stopped conveying liquid through the nozzle 205, following a previous phase where the liquid was passing through the nozzle 205 into the uppermost grow tray 201. In this embodiment, water is envisioned as the liquid passing through the system. As a result, the filling catchment is empty as all water has left through the openings 210 into the interior of the grow tray. Because water is not flowing into the filling catchment, the filling catchment is in a first position where water can flow out of the grow tray through the drainage outlet 208 as shown in the figure.\\nThe water flowing out of the uppermost grow tray 201 through drainage outlet 208 is conveyed into the filling catchment 207 of the second tray 202. As water continues to flow from the uppermost container 201 into the filling catchment, the filling catchment is moved into a second position preventing liquid from exiting the grow tray 202. As shown in the figure, water is constantly draining from the openings 210 in the filling catchment of grow tray 202 such that when the uppermost grow tray 201 is drained of water and ceases to convey water to the valve assembly of grow tray 202, the filling catchment of grow tray 202 will move to a first position and allow the second grow tray 202 to drain into the third grow tray 203. FIG. 2 also shows the situation wherein the second grow tray 202 has been filled to the maximum height allowed by the overflow outlet 209. Excess water that passes into the overflow outlet is conveyed to the filling catchment of the third tray 203, and begins to fill the third tray.\\nThe valve assembly of the third tray 203 is moved into the second position by the flow of water from the overflow outlet of the second tray 202. This prevents water from flowing out of the third tray which has begun to fill. As the water in the third tray has not reached the height set by the overflow outlet, no water has entered the fourth tray 204, and accordingly the valve assembly within the fourth tray is in the first position. In this embodiment, the drainage outlet and overflow outlet of the fourth tray 204 convey water back to the reservoir. It will be understood that in other embodiments, the fourth tray may instead convey water to a fifth tray, or there may be only three trays, the third tray conveying water to the reservoir, or any other number of trays wherein the bottommost tray returns water to the reservoir.\\nIn some embodiments, the overflow outlet 209 is able to be adjusted to define different maximum heights to which the grow trays can be filled. This may be accomplished by any known methods, such as providing a telescoping or extending mechanism within the body of the overflow outlet. This allows a user to optimize the flood/drain system in each tray for the particular crop being grown or the particular root system of the plants within the grow tray.\\nFIG. 3A shows a valve assembly 300 according to the present invention in a first position. The valve assembly 300 includes a filling catchment 301 which has a large opening 302 in which water can be conveyed as well as smaller drainage orifices or openings 303 which allow water to drain from the filling catchment. In this embodiment, these openings drain into the container, however it will be understood that in other embodiments, the openings may drain out of the container while still allowing the assembly to function. The filling catchment of this embodiment has a frusto-conical shape with the top of the filling catchment, including the opening 302, having a greater diameter than the bottom of the filling catchment. This maximizes the amount of water which can enter the filling catchment, while reducing size and encouraging draining through the smaller openings 303. This embodiment of a valve assembly is adapted to be located within a container with at least an opening in a bottom surface.\\nThe valve assembly 300 also includes a plugging member in the form of a rod 304 and plug 307. The plugging member is movable with the filling catchment. The plug 307 is located in a drainage chamber 305 which also includes an opening 309 into the drainage outlet 306. In FIG. 3A, the filling catchment is in a first position wherein liquid can pass into the drainage outlet 306 via opening 309. A biasing member in the form of a spring 308 provides a force to bias the filling catchment into the first position unless a force is applied to the filling catchment in a direction substantially towards the opening 309. In preferred embodiments, this force is balanced to be equal to or greater the force due to the weight of a volume of water within the filling catchment greater than the volume required to reach at least some of the smaller openings 303, that is to say if there is insufficient water in the filling catchment to continue flowing out of the smaller openings, then the filling catchment moves to the first position. In this embodiment, the drainage chamber 305 is configured so that a bottom surface of the chamber contacts the bottom surface of the container in which the valve assembly is located, in a way that creates a watertight seal between the two surfaces. This only allows the flow of liquid out of the container through the drainage outlet 306 in the drainage chamber 305.\\nFIG. 3B shows the valve assembly of FIG. 3A in a second position. Here, the filling catchment 301 has moved in the direction of the arrows towards the drainage chamber 305, bringing the plug 307 of the plugging member into contact with the opening 309 of the drainage outlet 306 to prevent liquid from leaving the container.\\nFIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C show a drainage chamber 401 and plugging member in a first, transitionary, and second position respectively. These figures show that the plugging member comprises a tube 405, rod 408, and plug 402. In the first position shown in FIG. 4A, the rod 407 is located within the tube 405 and the plug 402 is located at the top of the drainage chamber 401.\\nFIG. 4B shows the plugging member transitioning from a first to a second position. Here, the rod can be seen extending from the tube 405, and the shape of the plug 402 can most clearly be seen, the plug comprising a first element 406 and a second element 407. The first element in this embodiment is hemi-spherical in shape and is sized to fit into an opening 404 in the drainage chamber 401 to the drainage outlet 403. The second element 407 is sized to be larger than the opening 404. In this embodiment, the second element also has a flange around its circumference, and the opening 404 has a corresponding recess or lip which together provide a watertight seal when the plug is in the second position, as shown by FIG. 4C.\\nFIG. 4C most clearly shows rod 408 which is fully extended out of the tube 405 in the second position, and the plugging member prevents any liquid from flowing through the opening 404 and thus leaving the container through the drainage outlet 403.\\nSide and top views of another embodiment of a valve assembly according to the present invention are shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B respectively. This assembly 500 includes a filling catchment 501 connected to a plugging member 502 and an arm 503 connected to a pivot 504 at an opposing end to the filling catchment. Unlike the previous embodiments, the filling catchment in this embodiment is not in a frusto-conical shape but rather is shaped such that a lower internal surface proximate the location of plugging member 502 on the opposing side is provided at a distal end of the filling catchment to the pivot 504. The internal side surfaces are sloped so that any liquid which enters the catchment is directed towards this lower surface. In this embodiment, a drainage orifice (not shown) is provided in the lower surface of the filling catchment. The plugging member is in the form of a partially frusto-conical rubber stopper in this embodiment. In preferred embodiments, the pivot may be in the form of protrusions on the arm 503 or catchment 501 which cooperate with corresponding recesses or openings in a base 506 to provide the pivoting function. It will be understood that in other embodiments, other known methods of providing a pivoting function may be used without departing from the spirit of the invention.\\nThis embodiment also includes an adjustable overflow outlet 505 which is located on the base 506 which also is connected to the pivot 504. The base 506 can be attached to a container through any known methods, such as by screws or bolts. The adjustable overflow outlet 505 may be adjusted, for example, by the use of a castle nut. As in the previous embodiments, the overflow outlet acts to create a maximum height within the container for a liquid to fill to. A grate or mesh 507 is also provided in the filling catchment located over the drainage orifices to prevent any solids (such as soil particles) from blocking the drainage orifices.\\nA cross-sectional view of the embodiment of FIGS. 5A and 5B is shown in place in a container in FIG. 6. The assembly located within the container 601 comprises filling catchment 602, plugging member 603, overflow outlet 604, pivot 605 and arm 606. The overflow outlet 604 and pivot 605 are mounted on a base 609. Drainage outlet 607 is also provided in the container 601. The plugging member 603, which is in this embodiment in the form of a partially frusto-conical shaped rubber stopper, has an internal channel 608 which is connected to a drainage orifice 609 located in a lower surface of the filling catchment 602.\\nFIG. 6 also includes an adjustable overflow outlet 604 which is located on base 609 which includes an internal overflow channel 610 in fluid communication with the overflow outlet at a first end 611 and an exterior of the container at a second end 612. The first and second ends of the channel are offset such that liquid is conveyed towards the same location as the drainage outlet 607. The base 609 in this embodiment is attached to the container 601 by means of screws 613. It will be understood that in other embodiments, the base may be connected to the container by other methods, or integrated into the container itself. The cross-sectional view also shows that a mesh or grate 614 which is positioned over the drainage orifice 609 so that solids, for example soil particles or other contaminants, cannot cause the orifice to become clogged over repeated filling and draining processes.\\nIn the embodiments of FIGS. 5 and 6, the pivot causes the filling catchment and the plugging member to be movable in an arc-like motion from a first ‘upper’ position to a second ‘lower’ position, wherein a drainage outlet in the container is sealed by the plugging member in the second position. FIG. 5A shows the plugging member 502 in a first position while FIG. 6 shows the plugging member 603 in a second position. A biasing member, for example a spring located under the arm, is provided to bias the filling catchment and plugging member into the first position unless a force is applied to overcome it. In preferred embodiments, the biasing member is in the form of a compression spring located at a distal end of the base to the pivot, though it will be understood that in other embodiments, other biasing means may be used instead. As in the other embodiments, the force required to move the filling catchment may be balanced against the weight of liquid within the filling catchment, such that the catchment moves from the first position to the second position when the catchment is partially or substantially filled with water. Additionally or alternatively, the force required to overcome the biasing member may be balanced against the force exerted by water entering the filling catchment from a height, preferably where the height is the distance between the drainage outlet of the container above and the filling catchment of the valve assembly.\\nBy arranging the assembly in this manner, the overall height of the valve can be reduced relative to the previous embodiment, allowing more containers to be fitted a system of equivalent volume. Further, assemblies with this reduced height may be retrofitted to existing systems which may have low clearance between containers. The arcuate motion of the plugging member may also act to reduce the chance of the filling catchment becoming stuck on the biasing member when the plugging member moves between positions relative to movements in a vertical direction.\\nRather than the filling catchment containing a number of drainage orifices which convey liquid into the container as in the embodiments of FIGS. 2-4, the embodiments of FIGS. 5A, 5B and 6 include a single drainage orifice in a lower surface of the catchment, as well as an internal channel within the plugging member. Any liquid within the filling catchment in this embodiment is thus conveyed through this internal channel and out of the container.\\nThus, when liquid is poured into the filling catchment in this embodiment, the filling catchment and plugging member move to the second position where liquid cannot flow through the drainage outlet of the container. The drainage orifice and internal channel of the plugging member are sized to only allow a reduced flow of liquid relative to the drainage outlet, such as by providing the orifice and/or channel with a smaller diameter than the drainage outlet. As a result, liquid will leave the filling catchment far slower than liquid will enter the catchment, filling the catchment to the point it overflows and fills the container. Liquid will constantly drain at a slow rate from the drainage orifice and channel out of the filling catchment, preferably into the filling catchment of a second container or a reservoir for re-use. As the amount of liquid in the filling catchment decreases, the biasing member will act to bring the plugging member back into the first position, allowing the liquid that has filled the container to rapidly drain. The liquid can be directed into the filling catchment of a second container, repeating the process in a similar manner as described in respect to the previous embodiments. In some embodiments, the amount and rate of liquid conveyed through the drainage orifice may be insufficient to cause the plugging member of the second valve assembly to move, in other embodiments the flow of liquid may begin the flooding process for the second container prior to the draining process beginning in the first container.\\nAs an example of a potential application for the aforementioned valve assemblies and systems, FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of a system for growing plants according to the present invention. System 700 consists of a housing 701, in which two columns or stacks of vertically arranged grow trays 702 can be seen, as well as a reservoir 703 under each column. Not visible in this figure is a conduit that extends inside the wall of the housing 701 capable of conveying liquid from the reservoir to the uppermost grow tray, wherein a valve assembly as described in FIGS. 2-4 or FIGS. 5-6 is located in each grow tray. In the system of FIG. 7, one grow tray 702 has been removed from the system, showing the absence of any direct connections for channeling liquid in and out of the grow tray. The removal of the grow tray has left a space 704. Such a space may include a drawer-like sliding mechanism or other method of allowing a tray to easily slide in and out of the column.\\nWhile the embodiments above have been described in reference to vertically stacked growing trays, it will be appreciated that the valve assembly may be used in any sort of hydroponic operation where trays are removed/replaced for harvesting/planting. For instance, this valve may be particularly suited to operations which utilize a conveyor belt for easy harvesting, as no connections are required between a grow tray and a reservoir and a nozzle for dispensing water or other nutrient solution may be provided above the conveyor belt for supplying liquid to the grow trays.\\nIn some other embodiments, the valve assembly may be particularly suited for use as part of a modular hydroponic system where more trays can easily be added to the system without requiring the additional trays to be connected to any form of conduit.\\nIn the foregoing description of certain embodiments, specific terminology has been resorted to for the sake of clarity.
