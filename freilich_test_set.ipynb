For measuring kinase activity, ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay (Promega Corporation, V9102) was used. After the reaction, 25 μL of ADP-Glo reagent was added to each well of the plate, and the reaction was performed at morn temperature for 40 minutes to stop the kinase reaction and to deplete the remaining ATP. The kinase detection reagent was further added, and the reaction was performed at room temperature for 40 minutes, so as to cause conversion from ADP to ATP, a luciferase/luciferin coupling reaction and a luminous reaction by ATP. To evaluate the enzyme activity, the amount of luminescence in each well was measured by Envision™ (PerkinElmer Co., Ltd.). The luminescence values of the wells containing the kinase protein without adding the test substance was defined as 100% and the luminescence value of the wells adding neither the test substance nor the kinase protein was defined as 0%. Then, a luminescence value ratio in the presence of the test substance was calculated. On the basis of this luminescence value ratio, the concentration of the test substance necessary for inhibiting the kinase activity by 50% (i.e., an IC50 value) was calculated, and shown in Tables 11 and 12.',\n",
